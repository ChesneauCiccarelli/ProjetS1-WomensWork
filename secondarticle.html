				<p class="introduction" >Our developed country has many qualities. One might think that equal pay for men and women is one of them. Unfortunately, it would be wrong to think so. Although inequalities are decreasing, full gender pay equality is still far from being achieved.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="paragraphe1">
				<h2 class="sous-titre" >Inequality, from academic studies to gendered professions</h2>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Before looking at equal pay, we need to look at the gender distribution in the workplace. It is clear that the number of women working has increased over the past 40 years. In 2018, 68% of women aged 15-64 are in the workforce, whether employed or unemployed, 8 percentage points less than men. It should be noted that this gap was 31 points in 1975. This is certainly a visible evolution, but it is tending to stagnate.</p>

					<figcaption class="imagearticle__txt">Graph of participation, unemployment and part-time employment rates as a function of time</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">This number is also quite interesting considering the fact that women in France invest more time in higher education. Women are also more qualified than men in most of the higher education degrees. To give some figures here we consider that 84% of girls have the baccalaureate for only 74% of boys. Also, 49% of women aged 25 to 34 have a higher education degree in France. This rate is only 38% for men.</p>
				<blockquote> “Women have been earning more college degrees than men since the 1980s and now, for the first time, there are more college-educated women in the workforce than college-educated men. Minority women have also attained more education, and this has resulted in big gains in job growth for this population. Despite all this advancement, women, and especially minority women, still have a long way to go to reach parity with men in the workplace” - <a class="intextlink" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/07/02/now-theres-more-college-educated-women-than-men-in-workforce-but-women-still-lag-behind-men-in-pay/?sh=65daea794c31">Forbes Magazine</a> </blockquote>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Unfortunately, the workplace seems to raise inequalities. Women are underrepresented in the media, in politics, in certain manual jobs such as mechanics, construction work, and engineering. And in some other professions, they are over-represented. Professions gendered by society as midwife, ecthesian, nursery nurse, schoolteacher. In this society that could be qualified as sexist, we still find this idea of gendered professions as we could discover in the article: <a class="intextlink" href="article1.html">"Feminism, from the beginning of the ideology to the emancipation of women's work"</a>.</p>

			<section class="paragraphe2">
				<h2 class="sous-titre" >The myth of equal pay</h2>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Since the 1970s, the gap between a man's and a woman's salary has been narrowing. Society has changed a lot since then and one might think that now both genders earn equal pay for equal work. But again, no! Since the late 1990s, the pace of change has slowed dramatically. It is estimated that in 1970, the wage gap was about 51%, already 6% less than 10 years earlier. In 2018, the gap was still 19%. In a developed country like ours, this figure is intolerable.</p>
				<figure class="imagearticle">
					<img class="imagearticle__image" src="public/artimg/Article2/CaricatureWage.webp" alt="Cartoon of the wage inequality">
					<figcaption class="imagearticle__txt">Cartoon of the wage inequality</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Today, it is estimated that globally, women receive their salary with 16% less money than their male colleagues in the same position. If we align this to the French SMIC in 2021, the man would earn 1,589.47€. The woman on the other hand would only earn 1 293,11€. This gap is enormous in our society which wants to be is in perpetual evolution and egalitarian.</p>
				<blockquote>Smic is the acronym for Salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance. It corresponds to the minimum wage in force in France. Employers may not pay an employee, regardless of his or her employment contract, less than this threshold. The monthly minimum wage is EUR 1 589.47 as at 1 October 2021.</blockquote>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Without going into too much detail on this side of things, for women of color, immigrants or even women with children the result is worse. In our racist and borderline misogynistic society, it is estimated that full wage equality between men and women would only be achieved in several decades.</p>

				<p class="paragraphe__txt">It is everyone's job to move society forward, but even more so to the young. All the people who will live in the world of tomorrow and who want to make it better. I would like to introduce you to Rebecca Amsellem, an entrepreneur, economist and graduate of the Institute of Political Studies in Toulouse. Rebecca Amsellem is also a feminist activist. She created in 2015 the feminist newsletter of the name <a class="intextlink" href="https://lesglorieuses.fr/">"Les Glorieuses"</a>. A weekly of a club of more than 300 members. A place where we talk about the conditions of women in the world and the pioneering figures of feminism.</p>

				<p class="paragraphe__txt">In her book "Les Glorieuses, chroniques du féministe" she talks about some of her personal experiences in close connection with activist statements to change mentalities and make people think about the place of women in society. In addition, she highlights the figure of Olympe de Gouges, whom we quoted in the article <a class="intextlink" href="article1.html">"Feminism, from the beginning of the ideology to the emancipation of women's work"</a>, proudly recalling her incredible work as a woman.</p>

				<p class="paragraphe__txt spe">
					She is also known for launching the #5November16:47 movement. In short, the aim of the movement is to raise awareness of the issue of equal pay for women and men in France. The goal of the movement is obviously not to encourage women to stop working but to bring out reactions from citizens and the government. The movement wants to introduce 3 very concrete measures: 
					<ul class="intextlist">
						<li class="paragraphe__txt">A mandatory transparency of salaries in companies</li>
						<li class="paragraphe__txt">The introduction of a certificate of equal pay in companies</li>
						<li class="paragraphe__txt">A paternity leave equivalent to the maternity leave after childbirth (a key moment according to her where the inequalities increase considerably).</li>
					</ul>
                <p>This date changes every year since its creation, with new recommendations to try to improve the condition of women in this unequal and sexist society.</p>
