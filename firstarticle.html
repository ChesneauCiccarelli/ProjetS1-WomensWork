				<p class="introduction" >It should be noted that feminism is a complex ideology. Although there are some works from the late Middle Ages where some authors already criticise the place given to women, it is believed that the idea emerged in the 19th century thanks to Alexandre Dumas. He is a novelist and playwright who lived during the 19th century.</p>

				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Let me talk about a publication from 1791, the "Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne". In the middle of the French revolution, Marie Gouze, better known as Olympe de Gouges, shook up the society in place and claimed the role of women, too often neglected, scorned and set back. This text is a mirror based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. It will appear for the first time in the pamphlet of that time called "Les Droits de la femme". This document, addressed to the Queen, is one of the first documents to mention the legal equality of men and women in society.</p>

					<figcaption class="imagearticle__txt">“Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne”, by Olumpe de Gouges</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">At first glance, Olympe de Gouges imitates the style of the Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen. She criticizes the fact that the rights described in it apply only to men. It is necessary to know that at that time, women had neither the right to vote (which will come in France only on April 21, 1944), nor the access to the institutions (which will arrive under the Third Republic). Unfortunately, her text was totally ignored at that time. She was a victim of her gender, a victim of society, a victim of misogyny and lost her life, guillotined in 1793, under the Terror regime.</p>
				<blockquote>The Terror is the term commonly used to describe a period of the French Revolution between 1793 and 1794. It is characterised by the establishment of a revolutionary government</blockquote>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Finally, this story, although horrible, marks the beginning of change. It is thanks to the historian Olivier Blanc who in 1981 published a biography of Olympe de Gouges. A work that participates in the opening of minds on the life and memorable journey of this revolutionary activist. His work unlocks the political commitment of women.</p>

				<h2 class="sous-titre">Women's wage story</h2>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">In your opinion, since when are women allowed to work? This is a trick question. Indeed, women and men have the right to work, and this since a very long time. For example, in the Middle Ages, there were women doctors, women blacksmiths, women farmers, etc. A problem emerged at the end of the Fifteenth Century. Things change and society pushes women to stay at home, especially to take care of their children. Over time, women were excluded from work and those who still worked were paid less. Some are not paid at all. Society no longer recognized women's work.</p>

					<figcaption class="imagearticle__txt">Caricature of the woman in the kitchen</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">It was only at the beginning of the Twentieth Century that changes in women's wages were observed. In 1907, a law was passed in France that allowed women to earn a salary. Unfortunately, this law only applied to one condition: the husband's agreement. However, the society was happy to find women during the First World War. Indeed, it was women who replaced the men who had gone to war, in the factories.</p>

				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">They were the ones who kept the country's economy going. The society was not grateful because the recognition did not come until 1965. On that date, they obtained the right to work without their husband's prior consent. A great advance for the feminist movement. This right arrived thanks to the law of July 13, 1965 which was a reform of the matrimonial regimes.</p>
				<blockquote>“The law establishes the economic independence of each partner. Each partner is allowed to make decisions alone about domestic matters or regarding the education of children. Women can open bank accounts or choose to get a job without the authorisation of their husbands. Unless differently specified in the marriage contract, each partner is responsible for the goods acquired before the marriage and can decide how to use his or her own income without the agreement of the other partner, provided the marriage obligations are met.”</blockquote>

				<h2 class="sous-titre" >The industrial revolution and women's work parallelism</h2>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">It could be said that the industrial and working-class revolution has developed mentalities. On the contrary, it is estimated that in the 1960s men earned on average 60% more than women. This was for equal full-time jobs. In addition to that, women were rejected to gendered jobs and with low esteem. Jobs that did not reflect their qualifications but their quality as women. To talk about this topic, I'm going to present you the work of Madeleine Guilbert, a feminist sociologist of work.</p>
				<figure class="imagearticle" >
					<img class="imagearticle__image" src="public/artimg/Article1/MadeleineGuilbert.webp" alt="Picture of Madeleine Guilbert">
					<figcaption class="imagearticle__txt">Picture of Madeleine Guilbert</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">At a time when everyone was looking at men's work, she preferred to look at the functions of women in industry. Through her studies, she denounced the deplorable working conditions (speed, redundancy and the devaluation of work). Women are hired for their skills acquired in the family domain and not for their professional assets. Women's qualities should not be diverted into professional qualifications. All this led to a social devaluation of women's work. The work was divided between work done for men, and work reserved for women.</p>

					<figcaption class="imagearticle__txt">Caricature of the multi-tasking woman</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="paragraphe__txt">Although a very innovative work, a bit like Olympe de Gouges, the work of Madeleine Guilbert was not taken seriously. Her publication in 1946 in "La revue française du travail" the text "Le travail des femmes" did not have the impact it should have had. A text that denounced the "specialized work" of women, in a sexist world.</p>
